# I. README
## Introduction
	Overview and compare different data structures.
	Relevant personal notes: Other containers topic.
# II. Stack
## Why Stacks?
	Talk about applications for performance and history.
	Relevant personal notes: Stack topic.
## Stack And Heap
	Talk about applications of stack in memory
	management for C++, and well-known stack-related
	errors like stack overflow.
	Relevant personal notes: C++ stack topic, Stack overflow topic.
## Guess-a-Stack Example
	Make word game where you have to put letters in right order.
## Undo Function Problem
	Finish implementing the missing undo function for a simple
	drawing app.
	Relevant personal notes: Rocketship project topic.
## Solution
# III. Set
## Why Sets?
	Talk about applications for performance and databases.
## Hashing
	Explain why hashing helps improve performance.
	Relevant personal notes: Hashing topic.
## Set vs List Test Example
	Use Python's timing functions to benchmark performance
	on a certain test, for sets and for lists.
## Book Names Problem
	The program starts with a list of potential books. Each potential
	book has a list of alternate names in case the first
	choice is already taken.
	It checks to see if each book name is in a global list of all
	books and prints the result. After each check, it checks to see
	if any of the alternate names for that potential book are
	taken and displays them as well. The current function
	is_taken() function is mostly correct, but the global_list
	variable it references is implemented as the wrong data
	structure, causing the program to slow down too much to
	be practical. Implement the global_list and the is_taken()
	function with the right data structure.
## Solution
# IV. Tree
## Why Trees?
	Explain that insertion with a BST is O (log n), vs O (n) for
	a regular sorted array.
	Relevant personal notes: BST vs. binary search algorithm.
## Example
	A program that sorts events by the time they transpired,
	using a binary search tree.
## Problem
	Implement the remove() method to remove an event from the tree.
